# analystSurvey

This produces some analysis from the Army data workforce survey.

The two inputs for this are:
-2019 FEVS results, which you can download from here https://www.opm.gov/fevs/public-data-file/
-The Army results, which you can contact me about via Teams

The output is an Excel file with each table/statistic on its own tab.
